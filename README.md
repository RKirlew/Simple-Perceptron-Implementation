🧠 Simple Perceptron in C++

This project is a basic implementation of a Perceptron, one of the earliest types of artificial neural networks, using C++. It demonstrates how individual inputs with associated weights can be combined, passed through an activation function, and used to simulate decision-making — just like a biological neuron.
📜 History: Frank Rosenblatt and the Perceptron

Frank Rosenblatt (1928–1971) was an American psychologist and a pioneer in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

In 1957, Rosenblatt developed the Perceptron, one of the first models of an artificial neural network, on an IBM 704 computer at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.

Inspired by the way neurons work in the human brain, Rosenblatt proposed that:

    Neurons receive electrical signals as input.

    They process and store information.

    And based on this input and learned weights, they make decisions.

His Perceptron model introduced the idea of weighted input values, a threshold, and a binary output (0 or 1). When the weighted sum of inputs exceeds the threshold, the Perceptron “fires” — producing a 1; otherwise, it outputs 0.

This simple idea laid the foundation for the field of neural networks and deep learning.
